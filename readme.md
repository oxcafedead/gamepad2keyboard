# notice
This code was not intended to be public, it's awful and messy, I hope someday I will clean it up. I decided to publish this tool for other people who might want to use their gamepads to play some simple online games as nothing worked for me (from tools I used) - they were too complicated or just did not work.

If you have some issue/idea - feel free to contribute via PRs.
